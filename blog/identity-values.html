          <h1>Identity and values</h1>
            <quote>“I have discovered that even the mediocre can have adventures and even the fearful can achieve.” Sir Edmund Hillary</quote>
            <p>As I get older and have many different experiences, I've started to learn more and more about what my values are and who I am.
            It's hard to say what shapes values and identity. Are they formed early and determined by nature or by lived experiences themselves? 
            I think it's a bit of both. Hopefully, I can share how my values and identity have been formed.</p>
            <p>I am an United States citizen and I grew up in Illinois to two very hardworking entrepreneur parents. The US is a bit of a crazy place to grow up. 
            So much of life revolves around what you do for a living, how you make your money, and that even comes into play when you are a child. 
            You're constantly being asked what you want to be when you grow up. Where I grew up, at 13, they have you thinking about universities and where you should go to high school
            so you can get into those universities. Everything, and I mean everything, centers around being productive and making money (even if not for yourself, but for the man).
            My parents internalised this message very well and made sure to hand it down to their children. I was made to fear being lazy more than death. Because there was nothing worse than a lazy
            person (not even a dead person, because at least the dead don't cost money). So that being said, I grew up incredibly anxious and freaked out I was going to 
            live in a cardboard box. This made me hyperfocussed on education. I knew that my lack of sporting abilities and my quick ability to learn would mean education was the only way I was getting out of my
            crappy Illinois town. So I made that my ultimate priority.</p>
            <p>Throughout grade school, high school, and university, I did decently well. But this came at a cost. I had enormous anxiety, was a massive procrastinator, and generally would 
            find myself overwhelmed much of the time. I would pull all nighters to get papers done after putting them off because I was totally freaked out of where to even start. I remember one night studying for a 
            Chemistry final, I took caffeine pills and washed it down with 4 diet cokes. Without realising it, I totally overdosed on caffeine and I became severly dehydrated. I got shooting cramps in my 
            stomach and had to delay the exam because I was too ill to go in. Not my finest moment. I think there could 
            be a chance I had undiagnosed ADHD that whole time, but regardless, I got through it. So when you ask what my worst and best learning qualities are - I think of these stories. My worst of course
            is my ability to get totally overwhelmed and anxious to the point where I don't know how to complete something so I wait until the absolute last minute to start. However, the best
            quality would have to be my resilience and pushing through no matter what it takes. I am determined and will not allow myself to fail.</p>
